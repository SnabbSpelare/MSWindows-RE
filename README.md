# MSWindows-RE
Never listen to Microsoft telemetries and fake entries do your own work, feeling safer with a cleaner script to remove most if not all then at least some.

Can permanently uninstall some Microsoft software during use. Delete rows if you want to keep them.
These may include... it will ask on some selected apps

<pre>

  Cortana
  Camera
  Get Help
  Maps
  Microsoft Photos (Replaced with Windows Photo Viewer)
  People
  Phone Link
  Xbox Game Bar
  Movies & Shows (Replaced with VLC media player)
  WordPad (Replaced with Notepad)
  Notepad (Classic/Legacy replaced with standard)
  Voice recorder (Replaced with Audacity)
  
  </pre>

  The reason I decided to add the most used apps is that everyone uses other better-performing programs.
Delete & Forget enables cleaning techniques to make the process easier.
